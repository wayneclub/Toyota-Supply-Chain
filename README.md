# Toyota-Supply-Chain

Toyota’s supply chain is structured as a seamless flow from suppliers to customers. It starts with a strong keiretsu network of suppliers like Denso and Aisin, providing parts and materials. These feed into over 60 manufacturing plants worldwide, such as TMMK in the US and Motomachi in Japan. Parts are managed in global and regional warehouses, which support just-in-time delivery to assembly plants. After vehicles are produced, they move through distribution centers like Zeebrugge in Europe before reaching over 17,000 dealerships and, ultimately, customers around the world.”
